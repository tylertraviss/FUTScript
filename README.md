# FUTScript Repo
## Intent of Project
The intent of this project is to code a simplified version of FIFA Ultimate Team. This will be done using Python 3.8. It will follow the agile software development methodologies.

## User Stories (First Iteration)
1. I would like to be able to build, change, edit teams. This includes the 11-player pitch, and 5 substitutes.
2. I would like for players chemistry to depend on the relations of the leagues, and countries.
3. Option to play games against other teams.
4. Market to buy and sell cards.

## Contact Information
Code was written, tested, and compiled by Tyler Travis. The plan is to expand development team in the future, when a strong base model is built. Feel free to [reach out](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tylercarmantravis/) to me if you have any questions, or would like to get involved.
